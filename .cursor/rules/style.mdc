# Guidance and 

- Never import AllChem from rdkit \
  - ALlChem it is a very slow import. 
  - Instead, use the more specific import from the rdkit library.

- Always concisely document code. 

- Always write tests to verify code is working.
  - Tests should be short functions, that clearly localize problems when they fail.
  - make use of pytest.mark.paramterize and fixtures to reduce code duplication.
